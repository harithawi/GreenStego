How to use:

      For Encoding a text to an image
          * stego.py encode -f imageName -m "the message that you want to hide" -n newFileName

      For decoding a text from an image
          * stego.py decode -f imageName
Note: 
     I have created this script to hide a text inside an image in unnoticeable way but, be careful when you use long messages it will affect the color quality of the image and will      make it noticeable.
